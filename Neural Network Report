Deep learning and Neural Networks were used to determine whether applicants would be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The EIN and NAME were removed from the dataset. The remaining columns were used for the model. Classificaiton and Application_type were replaced with 'Other'. The data was then split into two sets of data. 

Neural Network was applied on each model two layers. The number of features dictated the number of hidden nodes.

The Neural Network trained model acieved over 70% prediction accuract with a 0.56 loss.
